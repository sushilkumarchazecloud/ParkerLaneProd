Hi there from Mailchimp,

We heard from Salesforce.com that your org is over its data storage limits and as a result we can't create any new Mailchimp records. You'll need to either remove some non-Mailchimp records or purchase additional storage from Salesforce.com.

Check your Storage Usage page in Setup for more information on data storage limits.

Thanks,

The Mailchimp for Salesforce Team
